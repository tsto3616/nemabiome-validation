# nemabiome-validation
Validaiton of nemabiome studies, with a focus on primer validation, replication, post PCR pooling and sequencing depth. 

Each cow (n=5) was sampled once. For each sample, a PCR reaction was performed on three replicates, respectively called PCR1, 2, 3. The resultant PCRs are pooled, mixing: PCR1 and 2, PCR1 and 3, PCR 2 and 3 and PCR1, 2 and 3. The four pooled samples and the 3 replicate PCRs were all individually sequenced

NEMA1:2 compares the effect of primers and replicates. NEMA pooled looked at the effect of pooling and Depth (NEMA1) is the R file for the sequencing depth comparison. Apart from the primer comparison all data uploaded in this branch is for NEMA 1 only. The excel files are for the R files.
