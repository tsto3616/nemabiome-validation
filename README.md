# nemabiome-validation
Validaiton of nemabiome studies, with a focus on primer validation, replication, post PCR pooling and sequencing depth. 

Each cow (n=5) was sampled once. For each sample, a PCR reaction was performed on three replicates, respectively called PCR1, 2, 3. The resultant PCRs are pooled, mixing: PCR1 and 2, PCR1 and 3, PCR 2 and 3 and PCR1, 2 and 3. The four pooled samples and the 3 replicate PCRs were all individually sequenced

This repository is split into 4 branches, the main one (this one), the DADA2 pipeline, the NMDS plot, and the individual bray curtis/ stacked barplots.
